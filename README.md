# EDA_1
Performing EDA on a marketing campaign and predicting the best strategy
We have a client dataset having details of their slaes and marketing campaigns
we are performing EDA using numpy,pandas libraries to restructure the client dataset
after this 	we visualized the dataset using matplotlib, seaborn libraries. This helped us in discovering outliers, missing values, and finding out correlations among the features.
Feature selection was performed post data visualization and correlations among features.
At the end through data visualization we know which marketing campaign is most successful, how relationship among variables can be leveraged to predicting success of new campaigns, which products are performing best, and which are underperforming
